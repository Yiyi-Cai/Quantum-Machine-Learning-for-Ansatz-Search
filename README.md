This repository contains code used to perform a quantum circuit ansatz search for simulating physics jets data. 
The data is in .h5 format.

In the folder "final_code", code for finding the optimal ansatz for simulating 2D jets feature is implemented. 
One simply needs to download all the files and run "usage.py."

For more generalized code that runs for both 2D and 3D features, take a look at the "generalized_code" folder. 
Simply change "dimension_setting.py" to desired dimension of features interested, and run corresponding usage files. 

Corresponding plots and data would be saved at the end of the run.
